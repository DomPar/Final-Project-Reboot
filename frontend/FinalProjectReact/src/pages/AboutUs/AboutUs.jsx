            We are Domingo, Mario, and Paula, the creative minds behind PetFriends. Our values and ethics are at the core of this app, which we have endeavored to imbue with our ethos. Additionally, all three of us are members of Reboot Academy, which has provided us with the opportunity to apply the programming skills we've acquired over the past two months. It has been an incredible and wonderful experience, one that has not only enhanced our professional growth but also enriched us as individuals.

            PetFriends is a reflection of our dedication and the knowledge we've gained during these two months. It embodies our love and respect for animals, as well as for the shelters and rescue organizations that undertake the remarkable task of rescuing and caring for animals in need. PetFriends serves as a connection point, linking users with their beloved pets and shelters with animals, allowing each pet to share its story and ensuring that every story finds its friend!
